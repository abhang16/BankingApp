# BankingApp 
Hello All

I have created a mini-application for a banking system in Java. 
In this program, I have soome functionalities of a bank account like a creating a bank account, deposit of amount, 
withdrawal of amount and showing bank account details.

First of all in any bank application program, it must ask for creation of bank account.
So in this program,in main method it will ask the user number of customers he wants to add and then it will add that much customers.
Then "Open Account" method will accept like account number,account type, customer name and deposit.

After accepting details for "n" customers , by showAccount method user can retrive the customer details.
By depositMoney method one can add money in deposit and by withdraw method one will be dedcuting it from account.
To initiate every method by taking user input here switch case is used.For every different method, different case number is assigned. 
By taking input of those numbers from user that methods will be applied. 1 is assinged to show account nethod, 2 is for searching details through account number,
3 and 4 are assigned to deposit and withdraw method respectively.
Also this switch case wont take inputs greater than 6, it will then show invalid input.

This is a simple project based on for loop and switch case.
